# Yammer Read All

[Yammer] does not have functionality to mark all message in “Inbox” as read. 
This [bookmarklet] fixes this behavior.

Javascript will navigate to each one of your unread messages, which will mark them as "read".
You have two options of doing it:
### Using Bookmarklet
-   Navigate to [Bookmarklet Home] and drag link into your bookmark bar
-   Navigate into your Yammer Inbox 
-   Click on bookmarklet
-   Enjoy code doing your manual work.
   
### Manual
-   Navigate into your Yammer Inbox
-   Open your browser console (F12)
-   Copy and paste JavaScript code from YammerReadAll.js into console and press Enter
-   Enjoy code doing your manual work.

### FAQ
What will happen if Yammer will change it's layout? 
> Sad news, it will stop working, Good news it should be easy to adjust and fix bookmarklet. I'll try to update it ASAP, however pull requests are more than welcome
